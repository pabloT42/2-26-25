#Create a function validate_passwordthat checks if a given password is strong.
#A strong password must be at least 8 characters long, contain a number,
#and an uppercase letter. Here's some helper code for the last part:

def validate_password(word):
    
    counter=0
    for a in word:
        counter+=1
        
    if counter >= 8:
        print ("the password is of necessary length")
    else:
        print ("the password is too short need to be a total of 8 or more characters")
    
    if any(c.isupper() for c in word):
        print("The string contains an uppercase")
    else:
        print("The string does not contain any uppercase letter.")
    
    num = False
    for i in word:
        if (i == '0' or i == '1' or i == '2' or i == '3'or i == '4' or i == '5' or i == '6' or i == '7' or i == '8' or i == '9'):
           num = True
    
    if num == True:
        print( "there is a number in your password")
    else:
        print( "there is no number in your password")
        
        #set up a counter equal to 0
    #have another for loop
    #add to the counter
    #check if the counter >=8

    

validate_password('Password2')
